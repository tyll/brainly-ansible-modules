module: zone_serial
version_added: 1.7
short_description: Automatic incrementing of zone's serial numbers.
description:
    - The zone_serial module takes care of keeping track of zone's serial \
    and incrementing it in case the zone itself changes. The current value \
    of the serial is stored on the server in "<param:dest>.serial" \
    file. Each time the module is called, it takes the zone "template" \
    located in "<param:src>" file and substitutes first \
    occurence of "__INTERNAL_ZONE_PLACEHOLDER" string with old serial. \
    If there are any changes detected, then a new serial is calculated \
    and there is one more substitution. Resulting zone text is then \
    saved into "<param:dest>" file.
    - The algorithm used for calculating new serial for zone is a bit \
    tricky. First, if the serial is provided using 'serial' parameter, \
    then depending if it is in the past or not it is either ignored \
    (YYYMMDDxx points into the past) or it overwrites the values stored \
    in '*.serial' file and/or calculated ones if '*.serial' file is not \
    present. If the serial parameter is not specified then the plugin \
    checks if the current serial of the zone is available in \
    "<param:dest>.serial". If so - it simply bumps, if not - it calculates \
    a new one basing on current year, time and month: YYYYMMDD00.
options:
    src:
        description:
            - path to the input zone file on the destination server with \
            "__INTERNAL_ZONE_PLACEHOLDER" placeholder for the zone's serial.
